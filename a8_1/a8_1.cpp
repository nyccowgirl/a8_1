 Assignment 8.1
 
 Write a Fraction class whose objects will represent fractions. You must provide the
 following member functions:
 
    - A set() operation that takes two integer arguments, a numerator and a denominator,
      and sets the calling object accordingly.

    - Arithmetic operations that add, subtract, multiply, and divide Fractions. These
      should be implemented as value returning functions that return a Fraction object.
      They should be named addedTo, subtract, multipliedBy, and dividedBy. In these
      functions you will need to declare a local "Fraction" variable, assign to it the
      result of the mathematical operation, and then return it.

    - A boolean operation named isEqualTo that compares two Fraction objects for equality.
      Since you aren't reducing your Fractions, you'll need to do this by
      cross-multiplying. A little review: if numerator1 * denominator2 equals denominator1
      * numerator2, then the Fractions are equal.

    - An output operation named print that displays the value of a Fraction object on the
      screen in the form numerator/denominator.
